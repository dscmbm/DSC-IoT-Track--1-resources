  Description: 
  We set up a push button and a common-anode RGB LED. The push button is 
  used to ensure that the wiring of the Red, Green, and Blue is as we 
  expect it.
  
  The wiring check code will blink a single LED, starting with Red. If the
  user sees another LED blinking, she will adjust the wire to pin 9 until
  the Red LED blinks. Once this is done she will hold down the button for 
  about 2 seconds then release it.  
  
  The Green LED should start blinking now. In case the Blue LED is 
  blinking, the user will need to reverse the wires connected to pin 10 
  and 11. Once this is done, the user can hold downi the button for 
  another 2 seconds and release it.  

  Finally, she should see a quick blink sequence: Red-Green-Blue,
  followed by the main part of the program.  That is, a heartbeat on each 
  color.
